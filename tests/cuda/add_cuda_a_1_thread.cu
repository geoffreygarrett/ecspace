/// \notes

/// 2. The __global__ keyword tells the compiler that this function will be called from the host, but executed on the device.

/// Memory Allocation in CUDA
/// \long_description
/// To compute on the GPU, I need to allocate memory accessible by the GPU.
/// Unified Memory in CUDA makes this easy by providing a single memory space
/// accessible by all GPUs and CPUs in your system. To allocate data in unified
/// memory, call cudaMallocManaged(), which returns a pointer that you can access
/// from host (CPU) code or device (GPU) code. To free the data, just pass
/// the pointer to cudaFree().
///
/// I just need to replace the calls to new in the code above with calls
/// to cudaMallocManaged(), and replace calls to delete [] with calls to cudaFree.

    /// This code checks for both synchronous and asynchronous errors.
    /// Invalid execution configuration parameters, e.g. too many threads
    /// per thread block, are reflected in the value of errSync returned
    /// by cudaGetLastError(). Asynchronous errors that occur on the device
    /// after control is returned to the host, such as out-of-bounds memory
    /// accesses, require a synchronization mechanism such as
    /// cudaDeviceSynchronize(), which blocks the host thread until all
    /// previously issued commands have completed. Any asynchronous error
    /// is returned by cudaDeviceSynchronize(). We can also check for
    /// asynchronous errors and reset the runtime error state by modifying
    /// the last statement to call cudaGetLastError().

    /// Device synchronization is expensive, because it causes the entire
    /// device to wait, destroying any potential for concurrency at that
    /// point in your program. So use it with care. Typically, I use
    /// preprocessor macros to insert asynchronous error checking only
    /// in debug builds of my code, and not in release builds.
