/// \brief Memory Allocation in CUDA
/// \long_description
/// To compute on the GPU, I need to allocate memory accessible by the GPU.
/// Unified Memory in CUDA makes this easy by providing a single memory space
/// accessible by all GPUs and CPUs in your system. To allocate data in unified
/// memory, call cudaMallocManaged(), which returns a pointer that you can access
/// from host (CPU) code or device (GPU) code. To free the data, just pass
/// the pointer to cudaFree().
///
/// I just need to replace the calls to new in the code above with calls
/// to cudaMallocManaged(), and replace calls to delete [] with calls to cudaFree.
